This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app), but converted to TypeScript.

## Getting Started

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
Additionally there is a proof of concept page available at [/experiment](http://localhost:3000/experiment) which makes use of some React hooks and toy components.

## Other commands

To build:

```bash
yarn build
```

To lint (provided by `eslint` and various plugins):

```bash
yarn lint
```

To run the unit tests (provided by `jest` and `test-library/react`):

```bash
yarn test
# or with coverage
yarn test --coverage
```

To autoformat source files:

```bash
yarn prettier
```

Additionally we recommend configuring `Prettier` to integrate with your IDE so it runs automatically as you work. [See more about that here](https://prettier.io/docs/en/editors.html)
